# Luci's habits

## Playing

It depends which type of Luci you'll get.
There are two options here

### Cuddly one

He wants to get as much attention as possible enjoys a good cuddle a lot and then will try to clean himself and also you by licking everything.

### Playful

In this mode is quite the racing car and wants to play with everything.
You also need to be a bit careful as he's scratching and trying to playfully bite you, there you need to tell him to stop.
The treats and toys can be found in the same cupboard where the dry food is in the kitchen.
He pretty much enjoys the rod with the mouse and also likes black hair bands from Verena which you can find below the plants in the living room.

### Hiding spot

If you can't find him, he somtimes hides behind the bed frame.

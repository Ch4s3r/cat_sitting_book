# Human treats

## Pizza
There's always freshly frozen Pizza from Lampe's L'Osteria available in the freezer.
To make it just grab a large pan from the lowest cupboard across the oven, heat it up and put a pizza in there and let it cook for some time on medium heat. Also don't forget to put the lid on.

## Fridge
Everything that you find in the fridge is free for all.

<!-- ## Coffee makers paradise
To make some fresh french press follow these easy and simple steps.

### Find the coffee isle
It's located next to the kitchen.

### Check electricity
If the appliances are not working, check that the energy switch behind the espresso machine is turned on and shining red.

### Prepare water
![coffee_water_heater.jpg](/img/coffee_water_heater.jpg)
Fill the water until the spout begins and then turn it on by pressing the right big black button.
Adjust the heat by turning the knob.
You can set it somehwere between 88 and 93 degrees, which works quite nice for us, the darker the roast, the lower you go with the temperature.
Afterwards press the button again to turn it off.

### Get the beans

Then use the wooden spoon on the espresso machine to swirl the coffee a few times and then put the lid on and just press it slightly, so that all coffee swimming on top is immersed under water and brewing.
Set a timer for eiter 4 or 10 minutes, depending on how strong you like your coffee.
Clean the spoon and put it back onto the espresso machine.

# Food habits

## 3 bowls?!? What is what

The middle bowl is the shared one which is for the dry food.
The left one is for `Lola` and the right one is for `Tama`.
Please try to check that they eat only out of their respective bowl.

## Time to feed!
Usually they like to eat in the morning at around 8:30 and in the evening at 17:30.
But as this would be a too high effort to feed them twice a day, it's enough if you can come by once a day.
At best typically in the morning, so they can keep on of their habits, but if it's not working for you once a day is also find, but morning is definitely preferred.

## Portion size
Currently, we only feed them dry food as Tama has a very sensible stomach and gets diarrhea if she eats wet food.
Please check before leaving that dry food is always filled to the maximum in all cans.
If they are empty, Tama will go and wander off to find some yummy hair she can eat and then puke on everything ;).

## Type of food
You can also mix them and put a different kind of dry food in each bowl, so they have a bit of diversity.

## Food location
All the food is located in the little room under the stairs.
There are multiple packages of dry food under the kitchen sink.

## Somebody said TREATS?!?
If they were well-behaved cats, or you just like that they like you more with treats, you can give them a few (5 max per cat).
They are in the kitchen drawer next to the cat bowls.

## Cleaning the bowls
The bowls should be cleaned about every two days, so there is no dirty smell that the cats don't like.
It's less of a problem with dry food, but still you would also take a new plate yourself every few days :).

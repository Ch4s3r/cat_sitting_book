## 3 bowls?!? What is what

The middle bowl is the shared one which is for the dry food.
The left one is for `Lola` and the right one is for `Tama`.
Please try to check that they eat only out of their respective bowl.

## Time to feed!
Usually they like to eat in the morning at around 8:30 and in the evening at 17:30.
But as this would be a too high effort to feed them twice a day, it's enough if you can come by once a day.
At best usually in the morning so they can keep on of their habits, but if it's not working for you once a day is also find, but morning is definitely preferred.

## Portion size



## Cans
Please put the cans in the plastic bag, we'll recycle them later.

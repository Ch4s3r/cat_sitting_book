# Luci's habits

## Playing

It depends which type of Luci you'll get.
There are two options here

### Cuddly one

He wants to get as much attention as possible enjoys a good cuddle a lot and then will try to clean himself and also you by licking everything.

### Playful

In this mode is quite the racing car and wants to play with everything.
You also need to be a bit careful as he's scratching and trying to playfully bite you, there you need to tell him to stop.
In the cupboard next to the food bowls where also the treats are located, you can find some toys.
He pretty much enjoys the rod with the mouse and also likes black hair bands from Verena which you can find below the plants in the living room.

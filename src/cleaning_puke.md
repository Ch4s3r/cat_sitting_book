# Cleaning the puke

## Checking the flat for accidents
Please check the flat for puke stains and clean them with the respective cleaner.
You can find them in the toilet downstairs.
The parquet cleaner as the name suggests is for the wooden floor.
For the rest please use only a little of the other one.
Also use the toilet paper for cleaning and throwing everything in the toilet and flushing it then.

## Keep shut
Please always close the human toilet seats, as the cats try to drink from there.

## Alternative toilets
Sometimes the cats don't got where they should do their business.
Some cats do their business next to the cat toilet, onto the black mats or right under the stairs in the cellar.
Please be so kind and check if you see something in there.

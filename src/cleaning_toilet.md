# Cleaning the toilet

## The good, the bad and the dirty
Where there is food there also is something brown to find.
The toilet is located in the top bathroom.
It is fully automated but still needs a little attention now and then.

## Cleaning the inside
Sometimes there is a little dirt sticking to the inside.
Take out the white grid on the front of the inside.

Please use the shovel on the right to scrap it off.
Put the grid back in when done.

## Removing the used litter
Check if the trash bin of the toilet is half full by pulling it out from below.

Pack the sack and then put a new plastic bag in.
You get this bag from underneath the sink in the bathroom or kitchen

## Unwanted tenants
In summer it's quite critical not to wait too long, as there might get some flies into the box and they will nest there, then also the cats don't like to go to the toilet there anymore.

## Throwing away that poo
When leaving the house right next to the entrance door there is the garbage room which you can open with the apartment key and throw it in there.

## Restocking the litter

If the litter looks like it's getting to an end, please refill it at maximum so full it still is closable.
Open the top of the toilet.

Then use the litter right next to the toilet to fill it up.

## Red carpet
Please also clean the pellets that are in front of the cat toilet, just grab the vacuum and away they go.

## Misinformation?!
If something is not where it should belong to, eg cleaning stuff, trash bags, please don't be shy and give me a call.

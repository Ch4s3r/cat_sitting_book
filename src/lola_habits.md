# Lola's habits

## Lot's of cuddles

She's the one really into cuddling.
But she's also quite shy at the beginning and trying to hide.
Even if she knows you very good, she'll try to run away, and you have to chase her and then cuddle her in a corner until she's done.
Don't give up too fast, she usually cuddles, then moves a few steps, then cuddles again, then moves again.  
She wants to have your attentation, even if she does complain a bit while getting cuddled.

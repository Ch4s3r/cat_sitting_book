## Drinks on the house!
We have prepared a water bowl for the cats.

## Location
It's located upstairs in the bathroom.  
Please keep the door open so the cats can always reach it.

## Refill
Please refill it everyday and give it a quick wipe.

<!-- ### How to
Pick up the top part by lifting it.
You don't need to unscrew the white top part from the metal part.
Fill in water until the max line.
Then put the metal part back on top again.

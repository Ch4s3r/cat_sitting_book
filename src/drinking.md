# Drinks

## Drinks on the house!
We have a fully automated water fountain for the cats, with a filter so the water does not get stale.

## Location
It's located upstairs in the bathroom.  
Please keep the door open so the cats can always reach it.

## Refill
Please refill it every wednesday and sunday with fresh water.
Or if you see it and there's no water coming out.

### How to
Pick up the top part by lifting it.
You don't need to unscrew the white top part from the metal part.
Fill in water until the max line.
Then put the metal part back on top again.

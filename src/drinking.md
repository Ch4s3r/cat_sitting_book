# Drinks

## Drinks on the house!
We have a fully automated water fountain for the cats, with a filter so the water does not get stale.

## Location
It's next to the food bowls, you literally can't miss it.

## Daily refill
Please refill it every wednesday and sunday with fresh water.

### Howto
Pick up the top part by lifting it.
You don't need to unscrew the white top part from the metal part.
Fill in water until the max line.
Then put the metal part back on top again.

## Long maintenance
It needs to cleaned thoroughly twice a week.
Usually we do this on `Wednesday` and `Sunday`.
So if you're lucky enough to have a cat sitting slot on one of these days.

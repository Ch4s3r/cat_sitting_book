# Drinks

## Drinks on the house!
We have a fully automated water fountain for the cats, with a filter so the water does not get stale.

## Maintenance
It needs to be taken care of twice a week.
Usually we do this on `Wednesday` and `Sunday`.
So if you're lucky enough to have a cat sitting slot on one of these days, please also change the water.


## Location
It's next to the food bowls, you literally can't miss it.

## Howto
Pick up the top part by lifting it.

## Disassembling
Turn the top white part to the left, then you can take it out.
Pick up the steel part.
Perfect you have disassembled it!

## Cleaning
Pour hot water over it wand clean it with a towel.

## Filling
Pour cold water into it until you reach a little bit under the `max` line.

## Assembling again
Follow the steps in reverse order from [Disassembling](#disassembling).
